# Context

The last assessment for Pacific Cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*) in British Columbia (BC) was completed in 2020 [@forrest2020; @dfo2019].
Separate assessments were undertaken for stocks in Area 3CD (West Coast Vancouver Island, WCVI) and Area 5ABCD (consisting of Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) and Hecate Strait (HS) combined). GMU have submitted a RSIA for an update to the stock assessment for both areas by November 2022 (advice for fishing opportunities in 2023).

The stock assessment is a delay-difference model, fit to commercial and survey indices of abundance, commercial catch and an an index of commercial mean weight, derived from commercial length samples. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a subsequent shift towards at-sea electronic monitoring, there has been no at-sea biological sampling on commercial trawl vessels since 2019. The 2020 assessment update used the 2019 mean weight value for 2020. In 2022, it has been four years since the time series of commercial mean weights was updated (i.e., no new data for the past three years).

Here, we report on the potential impact of the loss of commercial sampling in 2020-2022, by comparing results from the 2020 stock assessment [@dfo2021] with four alternative data treatments that attempt to mitigate a hypothetical loss of commercial biological sampling from 2018 to 2020. This represents a loss of the most recent three years of data from the 2020 stock assessment, to mimic the effect of losing three years of data (2020 to 2022) in the upcoming 2022 assessment.

We caution that the true impact of missing commercial length data from 2020 to 2022 can never be fully evaluated, as these data will never exist. However, the results of this analysis can provide guidance on the likely relative impact of using each of the four approaches on stock assessment results.

# Methods

## Model scenarios

For each area (3CD and 5ABCD), we evaluated four different treatments of the commercial mean weight index, by comparing model results to the Reference case [@dfo2021]. For each scenario, we compared estimates of biomass, recruitment, relative depletion and key model parameters to those from the 2020 assessment. Apart for the treatment of the final three years of the commercial mean weight index, all other model settings are identical to the reference cases.

The four treatments (scenarios) were:

**NOTE ABOUT 3CD BASE: the 2017 value was anomalously high (3.024 kg) and was not used in the 2020 assessment. There was no 2018 value. So here for Scenario 1, we will delete data for 2019-2020. For Scenario 2 we will use the 2016 value for the years 2018:2020 (maintaining the missing data in 2017 but adding a data point in 2018). For Scenario 3, we will use the average 2014-2016 for 2018-2020 (again,adding a data point in 2018) **

Sc 1. For 3CD, include no commercial mean weight index for the last four years of the assessment (the 2020 assessment had no data for 2017 and 2018). For 5ABCD, include no commercial mean weight index for the last four years of the assessment.

Sc 2. For 3CD, use the 2016 commercial mean weight index value for model years 2018, 2019 and 2020. For 5ABCD, use the 2017 commercial mean weight index value for model years 2018, 2019 and 2020. 

Sc 3. For 3CD, use the 2014-2016 average of the commercial mean weight index for model years 2018, 2019 and 2020. For 5ABCD, use the 2015-2017 average of the commercial mean weight index for model years 2018, 2019 and 2020.
   
Resulting mean weight indices are shown in **Figs 1-6 **).

## Effects of longer term data losses

*TODO: repeat a couple of the analyses (maybe 3 and 4) with 10 years lost data*

*TODO: add a table of the mean weights for each scenario (from csv)*

*TODO: add a note that survey lengths are length stratified and not useful for creating an index of mean weight*

# Results

*TODO: update text for sensitivity analyses, add biomass, recruitment and depletion tables, add depletion and recruitment plots, calculate percentage differences*
