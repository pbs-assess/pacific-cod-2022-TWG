# Context

The last assessment for Pacific Cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*) in British Columbia (BC) was completed in 2020 [@forrest2020; @dfo2019].
Separate assessments were undertaken for stocks in Area 3CD (West Coast Vancouver Island, WCVI) and Area 5ABCD (consisting of Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) and Hecate Strait (HS) combined).

The stock assessment is a delay-difference model, fit to commercial and survey indices of abundance, commercial catch and an an index of commercial mean weight, derived from commercial length samples. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been no biological sampling on commercial trawl vessels since 2019. The 2020 assessment update used the 2019 mean weight value for 2020. In 2022, it has been three years since the time series of commercial mean weights was updated.

Here, we report on the potential impact of the loss of commercial sampling, by comparing results from the 2020 assessment [@dfo2021] with four alternative data treatments that attempt to mitigate the loss of commercial biological sampling from 2020 to 2022. The four treatments are:

1. Include no commercial mean weight index for the last three years of the assessment.

2. Use the 2017 commercial mean weight index value for model years 2018, 2019 and 2020.

3. Use the 2015-2017 average of the commercial mean weight index for model years 2018, 2019 and 2020.

4. Use the ratio of an average mean weight index from the synoptic trawl survey to the commercial mean weight index. *TODO: There will be me multiple ways to do this*

We caution that the true impact of missing commercial length data from 2020 to 2022 can never be fully evaluated, as these data will never exist. However, the results of this analysis can provide guidance on the likely relative impact of using each of the four approaches to mitigating the loss of this data.

## Model scenarios
The four alternative mean weight scenarios for each area (3CD and 5ABCD) are compared to the 2020 reference case models [@dfo2021]. For each scenario, we compare estimates of biomass, recruitment, relative depletion and key model parameters. Except for the treatment of the final years of the commercial mean weight index, all other model settings are identical to the reference cases for each area in the 2020 stock assessment [@dfo2021].
