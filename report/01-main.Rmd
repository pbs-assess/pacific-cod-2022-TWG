# Context

The last assessment for Pacific Cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*) in British Columbia (BC) was completed in 2020 [@forrest2020; @dfo2019].
Separate assessments were undertaken for stocks in Area 3CD (West Coast Vancouver Island, WCVI) and Area 5ABCD (consisting of Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) and Hecate Strait (HS) combined). GMU have submitted a RSIA for an update to the stock assessment for both areas by November 2022 (advice for fishing opportunities in 2023).

The stock assessment is a delay-difference model, fit to commercial and survey indices of abundance, commercial catch and an an index of commercial mean weight, derived from commercial length samples. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a subsequent shift towards at-sea electronic monitoring, there has been no at-sea biological sampling on commercial trawl vessels since 2019. The 2020 assessment update used the 2019 mean weight value for 2020. In 2022, it has been four years since the time series of commercial mean weights was updated (i.e., no new data for the past three years).

Here, we report on the potential impact of the loss of commercial sampling in 2020-2022, by comparing results from the 2020 stock assessment [@dfo2021] with four alternative data treatments that attempt to mitigate a hypothetical loss of commercial biological sampling from 2018 to 2020. This represents a loss of the most recent three years of data from the 2020 stock assessment, to mimic the effect of losing three years of data (2020 to 2022) in the upcoming 2022 assessment.

We caution that the true impact of missing commercial length data from 2020 to 2022 can never be fully evaluated, as these data will never exist. However, the results of this analysis can provide guidance on the likely relative impact of using each of the four approaches on stock assessment results.

# Methods

## Model scenarios

For each area (3CD and 5ABCD), we evaluated four different treatments of the commercial mean weight index, by comparing model results to the Reference case [@dfo2021]. For each scenario, we compared estimates of biomass, recruitment, relative depletion and key model parameters to those from the 2020 assessment. Apart for the treatment of the final three years of the commercial mean weight index, all other model settings are identical to the reference cases.

The four treatments (scenarios) were:

Sc 1. Include no commercial mean weight index for the last three years of the assessment.

Sc 2. Use the 2017 commercial mean weight index value for model years 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Sc 3. Use the 2015-2017 average of the commercial mean weight index for model years 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Sc 4. Use linear regression to predict the commercial mean weight index in 2018-2020 from the mean weight index from the synoptic trawl survey.   

Scenarios 1-3 are straightforward. Resulting mean weight indices are shown in **Figs 1-6 **).

### Calibrating the commercial mean weight series to the mean weight from the synoptic surveys.

First, we calculated survey mean weight, using the same approach as for the commercial mean weights ... DESCRIBE METHOD

We then plotted the commercial mean weights against the survey mean weights from 1997-2016 (Area 3CD) or 1997-2017 (Area 5ABCD) (**Figure 7**).

We then fitted a linear regression to get the coefficient ... 

Then applied the coefficient to predict the commercial mean weight for 2018-2020 from the survey mean weight from 2018 (WCVI) and 2017-2019 (HS) ... for HS we interpolated survey mean weights for years with no survey, for WCVI, we just used 2018. Note, there was no WCVI survey in 2020 due to the pandemic.  

* This might not be worth the effort given that there was no WCVI survey in 2020. Do we want to do the regression on the whole time series starting in 1997 or more recent? *

Survey mean weight indices shown in **Figs 8 and 9**.

Commercial mean weight vs survey mean weight shown in **Figs 10 and 11**. *Show regression*

*Report coefficients*

Resulting commercial mean weight indices from predicting 2018-2020 are shown in *Figs 12 and 13*.

## Effects of longer term losses

*TODO: repeat a couple of the analyses (maybe 3 and 4) with 10 years lost data*

*TODO: add a table of the mean weights for each scenario (from csv)*
