# Context

This is the second report exploring methods for mitigating the loss of commercial sampling in the groundfish bottom trawl fishery. As for the first report (presented to the Technical Working Group (TWG) on June 27, 2022), we take the approach of evaluating how the 2020 assessment [@dfo2021] could have been affected by the loss of three years of commercial length data. We compare results from the 2020 stock assessment with an alternative treatment of the mean weight index for the years 2018-2020 by using a survey mean weight index to predict the commercial index, *assuming there had been no commercial sampling in the years 2018-2020*.

We use the survey mean weight index to predict the commercial mean weight index so that we can have a continuous mean weight index for the entire model period, beginning in 1956.

# Methods

For each of Area 3CD and Area 5ABCD, we followed these steps (details provided below):

Step 1. Develop a survey mean weight index, weighted by depth-stratum and catch weight;

Step 2. Perform a linear regression of log(commercial mean weight) on log(survey mean weight);

Step 3. Predict commercial mean weight from survey mean weight;

Step 4. Update model data files with predicted commercial mean weight index values for 2018-2020, noting that predicted commercial mean weight index values will only be available for years in which there was a survey. Make alternative data files, with and without interpolation between years with predictions.

Step 5. Run the models and evaluate sensitivity of model results to the updated commercial mean weight indices.

## Step 1. Survey mean weight index

We followed the steps in Appendix C of @forrest2020, which described the methodology for weighting the commercial length samples to produce a commercial mean weight index, weighted by sequential quarter and catch weight. For the survey, we replaced weighting by sequential quarter with weighting by depth stratum.

The calculation of the survey annual mean weight index was done in the following steps. The same steps were used in both Areas 3CD and 5ABCD. 

The values of the length-weight parameters used are for Area 3CD: `r paste0("$\\alpha = ", .ALPHA3, "$")` and `r paste0("$\\beta = ", .BETA3, "$")`; for Area 5ABCD: `r paste0("$\\alpha = ", .ALPHA, "$")` and `r paste0("$\\beta = ", .BETA, "$")`.

1. For each specimen $i$, in each Sample ID $j$, in each depth stratum $s$, convert individual length ($l_{i,j,s}$)  to weight ($w_{i,j,s}$):

\begin{equation}
{W_{i,j,s}} = \alpha{L_{i,j,s}}^{\beta}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ and $\alpha$ are constant length-weight parameters.

2. Calculate the mean weight ($W_j$) for each Sample ID ($j$), in each depth stratum $s$:

\begin{equation}
  {W_{j,s}} =  \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{j,s}}{{w_{i,j,s}}}}{{N_{j,s}}}
\end{equation}

where $N_{j,s}$ is the number of weights $w_{i,j,s}$ in sample ID $j$ and depth stratum $s$.

3. Calculate the mean weight ($W_s$) for each depth stratum $s$, weighted by the sample weights $S$:

\begin{equation}
{W_s} = \frac{{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{{N_s}} {{W_{j,s}S_{j,s}}}}}{{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{{N_s}} {{S_{j,s}}}}}
\end{equation}

where $N_s$ is the number of samples in depth stratum $s$.

4. Calculate the annual survey mean weight ($W$), weighted by the catch $C_s$ in each stratum $s$:

\begin{equation}
{W} = \frac{{\sum\limits_{s=1}^{{N}} {{W_sC_s}}}}{{\sum\limits_{s=1}^{{N}} {{C_s}}}}
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the number of depth strata surveyed in that year.

## Step 2 and 3. Linear regression of commercial mean weight on survey mean weight

We used a simple generalized linear regression (GLM) with a Gamma log link function, to estimate model fit of log  commercial mean weights ($y_t$) in year $t$ to log survey mean weights ($W_t$) from Step 1:

\begin{align}
{y_t} \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(\phi / \mu_t, \phi), \\
\log(\mu_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(W_t) 
\end{align}

where the $\phi$ parameter contributes to both the rate and shape of the Gamma distribution.

We then used the `predict` function in R to predict survey mean weights from commercial mean weights. Note that we included the 2021 survey indices for both areas in the regression model.

## Steps 4 and 5. Update model data files and run models

We used the predicted commercial mean weights to update the commercial mean weight index for the years 2018-2020. For all other years, we used the observed mean weight values, as used in the 2020 reference model. Using this approach, we note that commercial mean weights are only predicted for years when there was a survey. There are therefore gaps in the predicted commercial mean weight index for some years between 2018 and 2020.

For **Area 3CD**, there was a WCVI survey in 2018, but no survey in 2020. Therefore, for the 2018-2020 period of interest, there was only a predicted commercial mean weight index point in 2018. We ran two scenarios: **Scenario 1:** values for 2019 and 2020 were obtained by linear interpolation between the 2018 and 2021 predicted values; and **Scenario 2:** use only the 2018 value. 

For **Area 5ABCD**, there were HS and QCS synoptic surveys in 2019. Therefore, for the 2018-2020 period of interest, there was only a predicted commercial mean weight index point in 2019. We ran two scenarios: **Scenario 1:** the value for 2018 was obtained by linear interpolation between the 2017 and 2019 predicted values, and the value for 2020 was obtained by linear interpolation between the 2019 and 2021 predicted values; and **Scenario 2:** use only the 2019 value.

For both areas, the joint posterior distribution for each model was numerically approximated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routines built into AD Model Builder (Metropolis-Hastings algorithm) [@fournier2012]. Posterior samples were drawn every 2,500 iterations from a chain of length 5 million, resulting in 2,000 posterior samples (the first 1,000 samples were dropped to allow for sufficient burn-in).

Given current uncertainty in future commercial sampling programs, we also evaluated the impacts of 7-year medium-term losses of commercial length data compared to the 2020 Reference case models. See Appendix B for methods and results.

# Results

## Step 1. Survey mean weight index

Specimen weights were calculated from length data and length weight parameters using Equation 1. Specimen weights were also measured directly on the surveys. We chose to use the calculated weights, as this resulted in more samples. Using the directly-measured weights resulted in some depth strata without specimen weights. The relationship between measured and calculated weights was approximately linear (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-weights-3cd) and \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-weights-5abcd)).

Comparison between the survey mean weight index, calculated from Equation 4, and the observed commercial mean weight index is shown in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-3cd) and \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-3cd-2) for Area 3CD and in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-5abcd) and \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-5abcd-2) for Area 5ABCD. 

## Step 2 and 3. Linear regression of commercial mean weight on survey mean weight

For Area 3CD, the predicted commercial mean weight index (Equations 5 and 6) closely tracked the WCVI survey mean weight index (Figure \@ref(fig:all-mean-weight-series-3cd), green and blue series). It also tracked the observed commercial mean weight index until 2016 (Figure \@ref(fig:all-mean-weight-series-3cd), red series). After 2016, there is a mismatch in timing between the survey and commercial mean weight index. Survey data were collected in 2018 but no commercial samples were collected. There was no 2020 survey due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

For Area 5ABCD, the predicted commercial mean weight index (Figure \@ref(fig:all-mean-weight-series-5abcd), green series) followed the observed survey and commercial mean weight series (Figure \@ref(fig:all-mean-weight-series-5abcd), red and blue series) but did not capture the scale of interannual variation in the observed series.

## Steps 4 and 5. Update model data files and run models

Commercial mean weight values used in the model scenarios are provided in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-mean-weight-recent-3cd) and \@ref(tab:tab-mean-weight-recent-5abcd). 

Maximum posterior density (MPD) model fits to the commercial mean weight index from the Reference case model and Scenarios 1 and 2 are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-mean-weight-3cd) to \@ref(fig:fig-base-mean-weight-3cd-sc2). As in previous assessments [@forrest2020], model fits to the mean weight index in all scenarios were generally poor, with the models tending to underestimate observed mean weight, especially in the earlier part of the time series. 

Posterior biomass estimates from the Reference case model are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-model-ref-biomass-3cd). Compared to this model, Scenarios 1 and 2 resulted in reduced estimates of biomass for 2019-2020 and a reduced 2021 forecast (Table \@ref(tab:tab-est-biomass-3cd); Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-biomass-3cd)). The percentage change for the median 2021 forecast biomass ranged from -24.5% in Scenario 1 to -15.8% in Scenario 2 (Table \@ref(tab:tab-est-biomass-3cd-per)). Median posterior estimates of recruitment were much lower in 2019-2020 in Scenarios 1 and 2 compared to the Reference case, with the percentage change ranging from -53.9% in Scenario 1 to -27.8% in Scenario 2 (Table \@ref(tab:tab-est-recruit-3cd); Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-recr-3cd)). We note that biases were larger in Scenario 1, where interpolation was applied, than in Scenario 2, where it was not.

The lower estimates of 2019-2020 recruitment in Scenarios 1 and 2, compared to the Reference model, are mostly likely driven by the higher mean weights in 2018-2020 (Table \@ref(tab:tab-mean-weight-recent-3cd)), which would imply fewer small fish in the catch, all other things equal. 

Clearly from Tables \@ref(tab:tab-est-biomass-3cd-per) and \@ref(tab:tab-est-recruit-3cd), recruitment estimates are more strongly influenced by the mean weight index than biomass estimates, which are more directly influenced by catch and indices of abundance. However, given the short lifespan of Pacific cod in BC (~10-11 years) and the assumed early age of maturity in the models (2 years), changes in estimates of recruitment are expected to impact estimates of biomass relatively quickly.  

## Area 5ABCD

Maximum posterior density (MPD) model fits to the commercial mean weight index from the Reference case model and Scenarios 1 and 2 are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-mean-weight-5abcd) to \@ref(fig:fig-base-mean-weight-5abcd-sc3). As for Area 3CD and previous assessments [@forrest2015; @forrest2020], model fits in all scenarios tended to underestimate observed mean weight. In contrast to Area 3CD, mean weight index values for 2018-2020 in Scenarios 2-3 were more similar to the Reference model (Table \@ref(tab:tab-mean-weight-recent-5abcd)).

Posterior biomass estimates from the Reference case model are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-model-ref-biomass-5abcd). Scenario 1 resulted in decreased estimates of biomass for 2019-2020 and the 2021 forecast, while Scenarios 2 resulted in very slight decreases in 2019-2020 biomass estimates and a very slight increase in the 2021 forecast  (Table \@ref(tab:tab-est-biomass-5abcd); Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-biomass-5abcd)). The percentage changes for the 2021 biomass forecast ranged from -6.6% in Scenario 1 to 0.4% in Scenario 2 (Table \@ref(tab:tab-est-biomass-5abcd-per)). As for Area 3CD, biases were larger in Scenario 1, where interpolation was applied

Posterior estimates of recruitment in 2019-2020 differed by year and scenario compared to the Reference case, with the percentage change ranging from -12.2% in Scenario 2 to 9.9%, also in Scenario 2 (Table \@ref(tab:tab-est-recruit-5abcd); Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-recr-5abcd)).

As for Area 3CD, recruitment estimates were more strongly influenced by the mean weight index than biomass estimates (Tables \@ref(tab:tab-est-biomass-5abcd-per) and \@ref(tab:tab-est-recruit-5abcd)).

# Conclusions and recommendations

We were able to derive a survey mean weight index for each area, weighted by sample weights and catches in depth strata. We were able to derive a predicted commercial mean weight index from the survey mean weight index. 

The effects of the two alternative treatments were stronger for Area 3CD than for Area 5ABCD, especially for recruitment. This was because the last observed 2019 mean weight index value used in the Reference model was much lower (~0.5-1.0 kg lower) than the values used for 2018-2020 in Scenarios 1 and 2.

The results of this exercise highlight obvious differences in selectivity between the commercial fishery and synoptic surveys, especially in Area 5ABCD, where the survey catches much smaller fish. This represents a violation of the assumptions of the delay-difference model, which assumes knife-edged selectivity in both the survey and fishery. However, violation of this assumption is probably less consequential than the assumption of the same knife-edged maturity. As long as the relative selectivities in the survey and fishery remain approximately constant, calibration exercises such as this may be an acceptable approach to continue the time series of the commercial mean weight index, although this should be evaluated through simulation-testing. It should also be acknowledged that the surveys are biennial. Simple linear interpolation may be applied to fill in missing values, altough we note that biases were larger in both areas when interpolation was applied.

The decision point at this juncture is whether to proceed with a 2022 assessment update for Pacific Cod. The following considerations will inform this decision:

1. Whether the development of the survey mean weight index and the predicted commercial mean weight index require more work, including possible simulation-testing;

2. If no to (1), whether the work presented here requires full peer review through CSAS;

3. Whether further work is needed on the assessment itself (e.g., development of a recruitment index, consideration of other models);

4. Knowledge that the 2022 WCVI survey data will not be available until Fall 2022; and

5. Availability of Science staff, given time already spent on this exercise.

TODO: Don't show these tables because there is a small discrepancy between the model files and these numbers for pre-2019 years. This is because we only updated the end of the time series in 2020 and
used the old (2018) number for the rest of the time series. The differences are small but for the 
next assessment we should update the whole time series.
